# Simple USA Voting System


## Project Overview

The Simple Voting System is an interactive application that allows users to vote for their preferred candidates in a simulated election environment. This project is implemented in three programming languages: **Python**, **C#**, and **JavaScript**. Each implementation demonstrates the unique features and syntax of the respective language while maintaining the same core functionality.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a user-friendly platform for conducting and managing an election-style voting process. It allows users to register candidates, cast votes, and determine winners, while also handling ties through a second round of voting if necessary.

## Project Goals

- To create an easy-to-use voting system that can handle multiple candidates.
- To implement a mechanism for resolving ties through a second round of voting.
- To demonstrate the capabilities of Python, C#, and JavaScript in building command-line and web-based applications.

## Features

- **Candidate Registration**: Candidates are predefined and displayed with numbers for easy selection.
- **Voting Mechanism**: Users can vote by entering the candidate number. The application ensures valid inputs.
- **Result Display**: After voting, the system displays the results, including the number of votes each candidate received.
- **Tie Handling**: In the event of a tie, the system conducts a second round of voting among the tied candidates until a clear winner is determined.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear prompts and messages guide users through the voting process.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Used for the command-line interface implementation.
- **C#**: Implemented as a console application to showcase .NET capabilities.
- **JavaScript**: Developed as a web application using Node.js for server-side logic.
