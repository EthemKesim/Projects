USA Voting System 2024

A simple, console-based voting application implemented in three programming languages: C#, Python, and JavaScript. This application allows users to vote for a candidate with name/surname verification and includes a tie-breaking round if necessary.


Description
The USA Voting System 2024 is a console-based application that runs in C#, Python, and JavaScript, showcasing identical functionality across these languages. Users provide their name and surname to vote, and the application tracks votes and manages tie-breakers through additional rounds if needed.

Purpose
This project demonstrates how to build a basic voting system using three programming languages while providing a practical example of cross-language implementations.


Features
Name Check: Users provide their name to verify identity before voting
Candidate Options: Preset list of choices displayed for selection
Tallying Votes: Ballots are totaled after each round and results are printed.
Results Summary: Visual summary of vote percentages at the end.


Technologies
Python: Command-line interface using basic input/output

C#: .NET console app with System.Console for I/O

JavaScript: Node.js app with readline module for console I/O


Usage Guide
To run each version:

Python: Navigate to folder, run python voting_app.py

C#: Navigate to folder, run dotnet run

Node.js: Navigate to folder, run node voting_app.js


Interface Walkthrough
The interface guides users through candidate registration, voting and results display. Prompts and validation ensure a smooth experience.

Voting Process
1.	Users enter their name and surname to verify their identity.
2.	Candidates are displayed with corresponding numbers.
3.	Users vote by selecting the candidate's number.

Tie-Breaking Round
If there's a tie, a new round is started with only the tied candidates. The process continues until a winner is determined.

Project Structure
The project is organized by language, with each version containing its own main program file.
